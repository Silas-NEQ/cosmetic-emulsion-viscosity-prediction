## 🔬 Methodology

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analysis of variable distributions
- Correlation identification
- Outlier and missing value detection

### ⚙️ Pre-processing
- Categorical variable encoding (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)
- Feature normalisation and standardisation
- Train/test split (80/20)

### 🤖 Implemented Models
- **Polynomial Regression** - Selected model
- **Artificial Neural Networks Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **SVM Regressor**
- **Ensemble Methods** (Combination of the first three models in this list)

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **R² Score**: Variance explained by the model
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Mean error

## 📈 Results

The Polynomial Regression model was selected as definitive due to:
- 🎯 **Best performance** (R² = 0.903)
- ⚡ **High computational efficiency** (0.08s/run)
- 🔧 **Implementation and maintenance simplicity**
- 📈 **Best operational cost-benefit ratio**

## 💼 Practical Application

The model enables:
